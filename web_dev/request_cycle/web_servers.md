1)What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

David Both argues that - while Linux doesn't assume you're incompetent and handhold - unlike other systems, it  can be used by a wider range of people...so it's more accessible. Below are some of the major principles he says Linux refers to:

Small is Beautiful
Each Program Does One Thing Well
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
Make Every Program a Filter

2) In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

Virtual private servers are virtual machines containing their own copy of an operating system within a larger server. Internet hosting services often sell these to customers, who are drawn to the advantages VPS can offer -- for example, allowing the website a greater amount of server resources without needing to share it with other websites, which improves performance.
