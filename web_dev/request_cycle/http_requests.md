1) What are some common HTTP status codes?
Generally, those that start with 2 mean the request has been successful.
Those starting with 3 represents a redirect response, while status codes beginning
with four or five usually represent an error. There are rarely status codes that begin with 1, but when they do, it is informational.

Some specific examples:

200: the request was successful 
301: moved permanently 
403: it is forbidden to access the resource, therefore request is denied
404: the server was unable to find request 
500: internal server error prohibiting server from successfully completing request.

GET requests are used to retrieve data from a resource while a POST request is used to submit data - for example, from an HTML form - to a resource
