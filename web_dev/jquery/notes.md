Plan to tackle jQuery:

1) Do a basic Google search to see what kind of things to learn -- overview of the concepts about to tackle
2) Pick a few websites that offer a neat summary/cheat sheet, with examples
3) Make notes on what you're reading while bookmarking/making note here of websites that go into much further detail for later on:

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jqueryui/jqueryui_tabs.htm

http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/forms/article.php/3895776/HTML-Forms-jQuery-Basics---Getting-Started.htm

4) Create html document to play with each example 
5) Try own example
6) Take break, reflect on what learned or research further, add to notes -- repeat process for further examples.

What strategies worked: 

Playing around/experimenting while learning helped the most. In fact, my project ended up basically being a tiny cheat sheet of a website for myself on jQuery.
