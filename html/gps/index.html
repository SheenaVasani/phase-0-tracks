<ol> 
	<li> The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to add meaning to HTML sections and make the page more readable to those with dsabilities. I think think the most useful one is the main tag as it tells which is the main content. </li>
	<li> It appears the browser arranges elements on page by larger/structural to smaller. So from the larger header to the sections and then a smaller aside etc... </li>
	<li> I learned that Sublime has a lot more to it than I originally thought! I was excited by all the shortcuts and snippets. While I will definitely use them, however, I won't 100% rely on them as this challenge taught me some things can be missing. </li>
	<li> I think it was most difficult to understand the metatag stuff. I will need to read more about HTML layout and what the average page looks like on the internet and also by inspecting basic websites.  </li>
