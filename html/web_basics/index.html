  		<h1> Hello World! </h1>

  		<p> Today we are going to talk about food. Food is <strong> amazing. </strong> Let me repeat that: food is <em> AMAZING. </em> Here are some reasons why: </p>

  		<ol> 
  		     <li> Because I said so </li>
  		     <li> Some food tastes amazing </li>
  		     <li> Science says without food, we would die </li>
  		 </ol>

  		 Here are some examples of food I enjoy eating:

  		 <ul> 
  		    <li> Ice Cream </li>
            <li> Chocolate </li>
  		 </ul>
